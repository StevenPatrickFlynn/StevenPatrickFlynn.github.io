I am interested in developing and applying techniques from microlocal and semi-classical analysis to study operators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Sub-Riemannian geometry is a vast generalization of Riemannian geometry, providing a framework for gauge theory, control theory, and quantum mechanical phenomena, among other things. Singular objects in sub-Riemannian geometry have no Riemannian counterpart, and appear to dominate spectral behavior. Representation-theoretic techniques play a big role in my research. The main fields involved in my work are microlocal analysis, semi-classical analysis, sub-Riemannian geometry, inverse problems, and representation theory. Some general research directions include:

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>Microlocal and Semi-classical Analysis of Sub-elliptic Operators</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop a robust symbol calculus on sub-Riemannian manifolds using representation theory.</li>
    <li>Characterize quantum limits for subelliptic operators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Relate their invariance properties to the underlying geodesic flow.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>Integral Geometry and X-ray Transforms on Carnot Groups</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Proving injectivity and stability of X-ray transforms on Carnot Lie groups.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>Dynamics of a Particle in a Yang-Mills Field</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Study the scattering map and the X-ray transform for a particle in a Yang-Mills field on surfaces.</li>
    <li>Localization of a quantum particle in a Yang-Mills field and its energy asymptotics.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

I am generally interested in the analysis of operators on sub-riemannian manifolds (particularly those manifolds which appear as the configuration space of mechanical systems) using representation theory. Some general research dierctions include: <br/>

<b>Semi-classical analysis of hypoelliptic operators:</b>
<br/>
* Developing a robust symbol calculus on sub-Riemannian manifolds using representation theory. 
* Computing quantum limits for subelliptic operators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. 

<b>Integral geometry and X-ray transforms on Carnot Groups:</b>
* Proving injectivity and stability of X-ray transforms in the "flat" sub-Riemannian case"".
* Adapding results locally to general sub-riemannian manifolds.

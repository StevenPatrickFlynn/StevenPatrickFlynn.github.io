I am interested in developing and applying tecniques from microlocal and semi-classical analysis to study operators on sub-riemannian manifolds. Sub-Riemannian geometry is a vast generalization of Riemannian geometry, providing a framework for gauge theory, control theory, and quantum mechanical phenomena, among other things. Singular objects in sub-Riemannian geometry have no Riemannian counterpart, and appear to dominate spectral behavior. Representation-theoretic tecniques play a big role in my research. The main fields involved in my work are microlocal analysis, semi-classical analysis, sub-Riemannian geometry, inverse problems, representation theory.  Some general research dierctions include: <br/>

<b>Microlocal and Semi-classical analysis of sub-elliptic  operators:</b>
<br/> 
* Develop a robust symbol calculus on sub-Riemannian manifolds using representation theory. 
* Characterize quantum limits for subelliptic operators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Relate their invariance properties to the underlying geodesic flow.  


<b>Integral geometry and X-ray transforms on Carnot Groups:</b>
* Proving injectivity and stability of X-ray transforms on Carnot Lie groups.


<b>Dynamics or a particle in a Yang-Mills field:</b>
* Study the scattering map and the X-ray transform for a particle in a Yang-Mills field on surfaces. 
* Localization of a quantum particle in a Yang-Mills field and its energy asymptotics.

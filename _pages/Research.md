I am interested in the analysis of operators on sub-riemannian manifolds (particularly those manifolds which appear as the configuration space of mechanical systems) using representation theory. Some general research dierctions include: <br/>

<b>Semi-classical analysis of sub-elliptic  operators:</b>
<br/>
* Develop a robust symbol calculus on sub-Riemannian manifolds using representation theory. 
* Characterize quantum limits for subelliptic operators on sub-Riemannian manifolds. Relate their invariance properties to the underlying geodesic flow.  

<b>Integral geometry and X-ray transforms on Carnot Groups:</b>
* Proving injectivity and stability of X-ray transforms on Carnot Lie groups.

<b>Dynamics or a particle in a Yang-Mills field</b>
* Study the scattering map and the X-ray transform for a particle in a Yang-Mills field on surfaces. 
* Energy asymptotics localization of a quantum particle in a Yang-Mills field.

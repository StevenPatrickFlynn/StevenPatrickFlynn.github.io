I am a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Bath, supported  by the Research Project Grant (RPG-2020-037:[Quantum limits for sub-elliptic operators](https://people.bath.ac.uk/vcmf20/SubEllip.html)) funded by the Leverhulme Trust under [Véronique Ficher](https://people.bath.ac.uk/vcmf20/) (PI) and [Clotilde Fermanian](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/fermanian.clotilde/) (Co-PI). I am member of the Analysis group at the University of Bath.  <br/>

I received my Ph.D. in 2020 at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of [Richard Montgomery](https://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/) and [François Monard](https://people.ucsc.edu/~fmonard/). <br/>

In Fall 2019 I was a Program Assistant at the Mathematical Sciences Research Instute at  UC Berkeley in the semester program: [Micolocal Analysis](https://www.msri.org/programs/315). <br/>

In  2019, I was supported  as Graduate Student Researcher on the NSF grant "[Explicit methods for linear and non-linear tomograph](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1814104)y" (DMS-1814104, 2018-2020, PI: Francois Monard).

My research interests are broadly  geometric mechanics (sub-riemannian geometry), harmonic analysis on groups, and inverse problems. I am trained to use tools synthesizing microlocal analysis, differential geometry  and representation theory.

I am a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Bath, supported  by the Research Project Grant (RPG-2020-037: Quantum limits for sub-elliptic operators) funded by the Leverhulme Trust under [Véronique Ficher](https://people.bath.ac.uk/vcmf20/) (PI) and [Clotilde Fermanian](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/fermanian.clotilde/) (Co-PI).  <br/>

I received my Ph.D. in 2020 at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of [Richard Montgomery](https://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/) and [François Monard](https://people.ucsc.edu/~fmonard/). <br/>

In Fall 2019 I was a program assistant at the Mathematical Sciences Research Instute at  UC Berkeley in the semester program in Micolocal Analysis. <br/>

My broad research interests are geometric mechanics (sub-riemannian geometry), harmonic analysis on groups, and inverse problems. The tools I use synthesize microlocal analysis and representation theory.

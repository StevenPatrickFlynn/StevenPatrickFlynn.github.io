I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in mathematics and a member of the [Analysis Group](https://www.bath.ac.uk/teams/analysis-members/)  at the University of Bath. I am  supported  by the Research Project Grant (RPG-2020-037: [Quantum limits for sub-elliptic operators](https://people.bath.ac.uk/vcmf20/SubEllip.html)) which is funded by the Leverhulme Trust (PI:  [Véronique Ficher](https://people.bath.ac.uk/vcmf20/)) (Co-PI: [Clotilde Fermanian](https://perso.math.u-pem.fr/fermanian.clotilde/)).   <br/> 

I received my Ph.D. in 2020 at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the co-supervision of [Richard Montgomery](https://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/) and [François Monard](https://people.ucsc.edu/~fmonard/). <br/>

In Fall 2019, I was a Program Assistant at the Mathematical Sciences Research Instute at  UC Berkeley in the semester program: [Micolocal Analysis](https://www.msri.org/programs/315). <br/>

In  2019, I was supported  as Graduate Student Researcher on the NSF grant "[Explicit methods for linear and non-linear tomography](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1814104)" (DMS-1814104, 2018-2020, PI: Francois Monard).

My research interests are broadly  geometric mechanics (sub-riemannian geometry), harmonic analysis on groups, and inverse problems. I am trained to use tools synthesizing microlocal analysis, differential geometry  and representation theory.  

I am oragnizer of the [Bath Analysis Seminar](https://bath-analysis.github.io/).

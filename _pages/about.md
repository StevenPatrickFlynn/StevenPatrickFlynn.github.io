I am a Postdoctoral Research in mathematics at the University of Bath. I received my Ph.D. in 2020 at the University of California, Santa Cruz under the supervision of Richard Montgomery and Fran√ßois Monard. In Fall 2019 I was a program assistant at the Mathematical Sciences Research Instute in the semester program in Micolocal Analysis.
